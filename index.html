            <p class="text">Hi, I'm Tahuruzzoha Tuhin, doing my BSc in Mathematics at Shajalal University of Science and
                Technology.
                I have been programming for the last 3 years. I used to work on problem solving in C / C ++ programming
                language. In addition to solving problems. I have worked on a few Python projects. Also I am very
                proficient in Linux. I am now working as Chief Technology Officer of a startup. I actually want to work
                with artificial intelligence in the future. That's why I want to improve my skills in Python and machine
                learning.
